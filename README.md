# Qmes

**Q**uantum **M**eta-learning for **E**ncoding **S**election — a meta-learning framework that recommends a suitable quantum encoding circuit for a given dataset **without running any quantum evaluation at inference time**.

Given a new dataset `(X, y)` and a task type, Qmes extracts classical complexity meta-features and uses an offline-trained classical meta-learner to predict which encoding circuit (from a fixed pool) is most likely to perform best — collapsing what would otherwise be an expensive per-circuit quantum search into a single forward pass.

> **Status:** research code (v0.1.0). Classification and Regression pipelines are implemented end-to-end. Other task types are planned (see [Roadmap](#roadmap)).

## Idea in one paragraph

Choosing a quantum feature map for a dataset normally means evaluating every candidate circuit on that dataset — expensive, and it has to be redone for each new dataset. Qmes treats this as an **algorithm-selection problem** (in the sense of Rice, 1976): build an offline meta-dataset by evaluating every circuit on many benchmark datasets, describe each dataset with cheap classical complexity metrics, and train a classical model to map *meta-features → suitable circuit*. At inference time only the cheap classical part runs.

---

## Architecture

Three pluggable components, each an abstract base class with one concrete implementation per task type:

| Component | Base class | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Extractor** | `BaseExtractor` | Compute a fixed-length meta-feature vector from a dataset |
| **Evaluator** (Oracle) | `BaseEvaluator` | Score every circuit on a dataset to produce meta-labels (offline only) |
| **Recommender** | `PairwiseRecommender` | Classical meta-learner: predict a circuit ranking from meta-features |

```
                       OFFLINE (build meta-dataset + train)
   benchmark datasets ──► Extractor ──► meta-features ─┐
                      └─► Evaluator ──► circuit scores ─┴─► Recommender.fit()
                                                                 │
                                                                 ▼
                       INFERENCE (no quantum evaluation)   recommender.pkl
   new (X, y) ──► Extractor ──► meta-features ──► Recommender.predict() ──► ranked circuits
```

The split matters: the **Evaluator runs quantum kernel evaluations and is only used offline**. Inference touches the Extractor and Recommender only.

## Circuit pool

Seven encoding circuits, backed by the bundled **Qsun** simulator (`Qmes/Qsun/`):

| Name | Encoding |
|---|---|
| `unit` | Unit / amplitude-style encoding |
| `SRx` | Separable RX |
| `RY` | Angle encoding (RY) |
| `HERx` | Hardware-efficient embedding (RX) |
| `RY_CX` | RY with linear CX entanglement |
| `ZFM` | Z feature map |
| `HD` | High-dimensional encoding |

All circuits except `unit` scale inputs to `[0, π]`. The pool is defined in `Qmes/circuits/registry.py` and is intentionally easy to extend.

## Implemented task types

### Tabular classification
- **Extractor** (`ClassificationExtractor`): 22 Problexity complexity measures (Lorena et al.). Stochastic measures (`l3`, `n4`) are averaged over multiple seeds for determinism; data is min-max scaled internally as Problexity requires.
- **Evaluator** (`ClassificationEvaluator`): SVC with a **precomputed quantum fidelity kernel**, 3-fold stratified CV. Preprocessing per fold: `StandardScaler → PCA → MinMaxScaler` (PCA fit on the train split only). Primary metric: **MCC** (also reports accuracy, F1).
- **Recommender**: pairwise One-vs-One over the 7 circuits.

### Tabular regression
- **Extractor** (`RegressionExtractor`): 12 Problexity regression measures — `c1–c4` (correlation), `l1–l3` (linearity), `s1–s4` (smoothness), `t2` (dimensionality).
- **Evaluator** (`RegressionEvaluator`): KernelRidge with a **precomputed quantum fidelity kernel**, 3-fold KFold CV, same `StandardScaler → PCA → MinMaxScaler` order. Primary metric: **R²** (also reports RMSE, MAE).
- **Recommender**: pairwise One-vs-One.

> Note: both task types use **quantum-kernel methods** as the Oracle, not variational circuits. A fixed-kernel Oracle is deterministic and isolates the contribution of the *encoding* (no trainable ansatz parameters to confound the signal).

---

## The recommender (pairwise One-vs-One)

`PairwiseRecommender` trains one binary classifier for each of the C(7,2) = 21 circuit pairs. Each classifier learns, from meta-features, which of two circuits scores higher. At prediction time the 21 votes are aggregated into a full ranking.

- **Tied threshold** (`0.01`): two circuits are treated as tied if their metric values are within this absolute delta — used so the Oracle's "best" set isn't artificially narrow.
- **Model selection** (`recommender/selection.py`): exhaustive **Leave-One-Out** over (classifier × MI-selected feature subset). LOO accuracy on the meta-dataset is the validation signal — pairwise classifiers reaching training accuracy 1.0 is expected and not a sign of overfitting.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tungduy1704/Qmes.git
cd Qmes
pip install -e .
```

Requires **Python ≥ 3.10**.

> **Dependencies are not yet declared in `pyproject.toml`.** Until that's fixed, install the runtime deps manually:
> ```bash
> pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn problexity ucimlrepo
> ```
> Qsun is bundled inside the package — no separate install needed.

## Quick start (inference)

Plan to update soon!!!

## Offline pipeline (build meta-dataset + train)

Numbered scripts under `scripts/clf/` and `scripts/reg/` run the full offline workflow. Run them in order:

| Step | Script | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1_extract.py` | Meta-features for all benchmark datasets |
| 2 | `2_evaluate.py` | Quantum-kernel circuit scores (the Oracle / meta-labels) |
| 3 | `3_train.py` | LOO model selection over classifiers × feature subsets |
| 4 | `4_select_save.py` | Fit and serialize the chosen recommender bundle(s) |
| 5 | `5_inference.py` | End-to-end evaluation on held-out datasets |
| 6 | `6_baseline.py` | Baseline comparisons |

## Design notes

- **MCC over accuracy** for the classification Oracle — the two diverge sharply on imbalanced datasets.
- **R² over RMSE/MAE** for regression — scale-independent, so circuit rankings are comparable across datasets with different target scales.
- **PCA is fit inside the CV loop on the train split only** — fitting on full data before the split would leak information.
- **Fixed-kernel Oracle, not VQC** — a trainable ansatz would entangle encoding quality with optimization, making meta-labels unreliable.
- **Known limitation:** MI feature selection is computed before the LOO loop, which introduces a small optimistic bias. Documented and accepted for now.

  abstract  = {Currently, quantum hardware is restrained by noises and qubit numbers. Thus, a quantum virtual machine (QVM) that simulates operations of a quantum computer on classical computers is a vital tool for developing and testing quantum algorithms before deploying them on real quantum computers. Various variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been proposed and tested on QVMs to surpass the limitations of quantum hardware. Our goal is to exploit further the VQAs towards practical applications of quantum machine learning (QML) using state-of-the-art quantum computers. In this paper, we first introduce a QVM named Qsun, whose operation is underlined by quantum state wavefunctions. The platform provides native tools supporting VQAs. Especially using the parameter-shift rule, we implement quantum differentiable programming essential for gradient-based optimization. We then report two tests representative of QML: quantum linear regression and quantum neural network.}
